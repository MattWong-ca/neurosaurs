# Neurosaurs
A concentration game powered by the Neurosity Crown üß†

Unlock the power of your mind with our concentration game powered by the Neurosity Crown! Dive into the classic Chrome Dino game like never before, where your focus determines the outcome. As you play, the Neurosity Crown tracks your concentration levels in real-time, transforming your mental focus into digital rewards. The more you concentrate, the better the rare dino NFT you'll receive as a testament to your skills. It's not just a game; it's a unique fusion of neurotechnology and blockchain that turns your mental prowess into collectible assets. Train your brain, level up your focus, and collect exclusive NFTs to show off your mental game!

# How it works
1. Connect your wallet with Dynamic
2. Connect your Neurosity Crown, make sure there's live data coming in
3. The Neurosity SDK subscribes to live data from the Crown
4. Play the dino game, the more you concentrate, the further you'll go
5. Collect an NFT based on your performance, which is uploaded to Walrus
6. NFT is minted on Skale, Polygon, Morph, Flow, and Sepolia

# Tech Stack
üíô Dynamic: integrated Dynamic React SDK for seamless multi-chain onboarding experience. The user's address was retrieved to mint their Neurosaur NFT.

ü¶≠ Walrus: the client HTTP API was used to upload an image file of the Neurosaur NFTs, with the object ID stored in Supabase for future retrieval. The entire React.js site was also deployed on Walrus, making the frontend decentralized: [link](https://23fucb11zz47mkdp6hloun5q14e8vrvx0amnv64kq5mz5m2k31.walrus.site/)

üåä Flow: deployed the consumer-focused Neurosaur NFTs on the Flow blockchain. 

üõ†Ô∏è Skale: deployed Neurosaur NFTs on the Calypso Hub, with zero gas fees enhancing the user experience of users minting the NFT.

üíú Polygon: deployed Neurosaur NFTs on Polygon Amoy, leveraging AI to hyper-personalize the NFTs you mint.

üê® Morph: deployed Neurosaur NFTs on Morph Holesky. Documentation was super smooth, it was super easy to set up and deploy a contract. The fundamental concepts also gave good context into Morph.
